    - If you keep working hard the way you are doing, it will definitely take your career to the places you want it to go
    - You are truly wanted and loved by your people around you
    - You have the best of friends and you friends will always support you
    - It's failure that gives you the proper perspective on success
    - It is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default
    - Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts
    - You might feel like this because you stay alone, but you do have people who care about you and are just a call away
    - You will have a wonderful career ahead
    - Try to see the good things about yourself, focus more on the positive
    - You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door in the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on them. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space
    - Giving up is the only sure way to fail
    - Failures are necessary in your journey, as they teach you a lot about taking the right steps
    - When you take risks you learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important
    - Although it might not look like it right now, but you will soon be over it and living your life to the fullest
    - Failure isn't fatal, but failure to change might be
    - Strongest of characters have to go through the suffering that you are going through. You just have to learn from it and use it to better yourself.
    - These failures will be the stepping stones for your success if you learn from them
    - Life is very long and these bad moments are there to teach us things otherwise we take for granted.
    - Everything you want is on the other side of fear
    - This suffering will only make you a stronger individual and you will soon be over it
    - You are loved by a lot of people, you just don’t realize it
    - We need to accept that we won't always make the right decisions, that we'll screw up royally sometimes – understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success
    - You have absolutely no reason to be so negative about yourself, you are truly an amazing individual
