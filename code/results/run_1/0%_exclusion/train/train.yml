    - Everything you want is on the other side of fear
    - Try to see the good things about yourself, focus more on the positive
    - Learning from more mistakes simply means you are learning faster
    - You are loved by a lot of people, you just don’t realize it
    - We need to accept that we won't always make the right decisions, that we'll screw up royally sometimes – understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success
    - Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly
    - Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts
    - It's failure that gives you the proper perspective on success
    - These failures will be the stepping stones for your success if you learn from them
    - If you keep working hard the way you are doing, it will definitely take your career to the places you want it to go
    - You are not alone in this, it will be fine
    - Giving up is the only sure way to fail
    - Failure isn't fatal, but failure to change might be
    - You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door in the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on them. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space
    - When you take risks you learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important
    - You have the best of friends and you friends will always support you
    - Although it might not look like it right now, but you will soon be over it and living your life to the fullest
    - You will have a wonderful career ahead
    - Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing
    - You are truly wanted and loved by your people around you
    - Failure is a part of the process. You just learn to pick yourself back up
    - Life is very long and these bad moments are there to teach us things otherwise we take for granted.
