  examples: |
    - You are loved by a lot of people, you just don’t realize it
    - It's failure that gives you the proper perspective on success
    - Failure is a part of the process. You just learn to pick yourself back up
    - Failure isn't fatal, but failure to change might be
    - You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door in the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on them. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space
    - Life is very long and these bad moments are there to teach us things otherwise we take for granted.
    - When you take risks you learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important
    - We need to accept that we won't always make the right decisions, that we'll screw up royally sometimes – understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success
    - These failures will be the stepping stones for your success if you learn from them
    - You are not alone in this, it will be fine
    - Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing
    - Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts
